# SAP Analytics Cloud Dashboards - Project Overview

## Project Description
This project showcases the development of three interactive, enterprise-level dashboards using SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC). The dashboards provide actionable insights into key business areas: Finance, Sales, and Human Resources. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in data modeling, visualization, storytelling, and predictive planning within the SAC platform.

## Business Objectives
- **Finance:** To track profitability, monitor cash flow, and compare actuals against budget in real-time.
- **Sales:** To visualize the sales pipeline, analyze performance by region and product, and forecast future revenue.
- **HR:** To monitor workforce trends, analyze attrition drivers, and track hiring metrics to support strategic decision-making.

## Key Features Implemented
- **Data Integration:** Imported and modeled structured data from CSV sources.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Created a variety of charts (bar, line, pie, geo maps, waterfall) with drill-down capabilities.
- **Filters & Input Controls:** Added dynamic filters for time, region, and product categories.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Utilized SAC's built-in time-series forecasting for sales and attrition trends.
- **Planning:** Developed a planning model for "what-if" budget scenario analysis (Finance dashboard).

## Technology Stack
- **Primary Platform:** SAP Analytics Cloud
- **Data Sources:** CSV files
- **Key SAC Features Used:** Models, Stories, Digital Boardroom (preview), Predictive Forecasting, Planning

## Project Value
This project simulates a real-world business intelligence implementation, demonstrating the ability to transform raw data into strategic insights that can drive business growth, optimize operations, and improve resource allocation.
